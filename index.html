            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I am football and volleyball player.
                I sometimes work as a drummer in my band named teen tarey band as i like to expressed my feelings and emotions playing drums.
                Sometime i like to try writing poems as i am related to music part and i am a music lover as i am active in expressing my feelings to it.
              I have presented my poem over here: <br> "Oval portrait"<br>
Complimented she, happy her being shy,<br>
Selfish me can't focus out from her eye;<br>
She don't know, what to relie at all,<br>
Unaware of her beauty, mirror becomes her rival;<br>

A red, red chicks of her, like apple,I grabbed,<br>
Just like rarest beauty of all, I was trapped;<br>
Her beauty killed me, ground I laid,<br>
For that, 4 years were paid;<br>

Her innocence tells at all, she was great,<br>
Thus, I am the painter and she is my "Oval Portrait".<br>
